# Vehicle-Detection-And-Counting-using-OpenCV
Programming language- python  

We created a system in this project that can recognize and count cars in real-time with the help of OpenCV and Python. The system applies a pre-trained car detection model to identify cars in every frame of the video stream and follows them between frames to count them correctly. The system shows the number of cars on the video stream.
